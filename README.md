# TensorFlow 2.x Deep Learning Python Notebooks

This repository contains Python Jupyter notebooks implementing the code samples found in the relevant deep learning literature. Note that the literature features far more content than you will find in these notebooks, primarily further explanations and figures. Here we have only included the code samples themselves and immediately related surrounding comments. The notebooks have been adapted for TensorFlow 2.x and use Python 3.x.
